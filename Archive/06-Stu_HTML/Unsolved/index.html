    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

    <p>
      
      Hi, my name is Hunter McCarthy. I live in Cocoa Beach, FL. I began the coding boot camp to further my coding knowledge and potentially open
      the door for new career opportunities. I work full-time as a process technician, analyzing business processes and finding ways to make them more
      efficient. My first real coding experience was learning VBA in Excel, but a large chunk of my current job is working on PowerApps, which is 
      a low-code solution developed by Microsoft to quickly create software for business solutions without needing to be a full software programmer.
      Right before starting this boot camping I was taking intro to software development at F.I.T. In what little free time I do have, I enjoy
      freediving in Florida's freshwater springs and reading.
